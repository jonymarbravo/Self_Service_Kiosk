# ☕ Self-Service Kiosk for Coffee Shops 🚀  

Welcome to the **Self-Service Kiosk**, a dedicated ordering system designed **exclusively for laptop screens**. This system streamlines the customer experience by allowing self-service ordering in coffee shops, reducing wait times and improving efficiency.  

## 🌟 Features  
✅ **Laptop-Optimized Design** – Specifically built for kiosk setups, **not mobile-responsive**.  
✅ **Easy Customer Ordering** – Customers can quickly place their coffee, juice, or sandwich orders.  
✅ **VIP/PWD Priority System** – Ensures priority customers receive faster service.  
✅ **Dine-In or Take-Out Options** – Customers can select their preferred service type.  
✅ **Real-Time Admin Dashboard** – Displays and updates customer orders instantly.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. **Customers use the kiosk** to place their orders on a laptop-based interface.  
2. A **priority number** is generated, and VIP/PWD prioritization is handled automatically.  
3. **Orders appear on the admin dashboard**, where staff can track and manage them.  
4. Customers can **repeat orders or finalize their purchase** before exiting.
